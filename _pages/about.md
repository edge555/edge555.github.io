Greetings!

I am Shoaib Ahmed, I have completed B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST), Dhaka, Bangladesh. I was actively engaged in programming contest in my varsity days, and in research work based on ML, LLM. For a sustainable world, small steps do matter. I believe in computer based solutions ( collaborating with other sectors) for building and leading community in order to fulfill our purposes together.

<b>I am open to any Research Collaborations in the field of GenAI, LLM, Virtual Reality, NLP and Bioinformatics. Please reach out if you have anything to discuss or want to work together.</b> <a href="ahmed.shoaib1729@gmail.com"><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> <br />
